# Particle Visualizer

An interactive particle physics simulator built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. This project allows users to create and manipulate particles with various physics properties and visual effects.

## Features

- Interactive particle creation and manipulation
- Multiple particle shapes (circle, square, triangle)
- Nuclear mode with advanced physics simulation
- Customizable settings:
  - Particle count
  - Initial particles
  - Particle speed
  - Trail length
  - Gravity
  - Color modes
  - Background options
- Save and load presets
- Real-time statistics (FPS, particle count, energy)
